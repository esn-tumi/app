## Local setup

Follow this guide to get the project up and running on your local machine.

Clone the project
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/esn-tumi/app.git
  cd app
  # Install all dependencies
  yarn install
```

### Run the client

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd legacy-app
```

#### Without local server (for frontend only)

This uses the server running on `server.esn.world` which is also used by the live version.

```bash
  yarn dev:light
```

If you need changes in the server and don't want to implement them yourself server you can line
out what the API should return for you feature and open an issue.

#### With local server

To fetch data you need to have the **server** running on localhost as well.

```bash
  yarn dev
```

### Run the server

The server requires a running instance of Postgres. You can use docker to run it:

```bash
docker run --name tumi-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
```

To intialize or reset the database run the following commands:
```bash
cd server
yarn prisma:reset-dev
```
This command will drop the entire database and re-create it with the latest schema and seed data.   
If you want to inspect the data in the database run the following command:
```bash
yarn prisma:studio-dev
```

Then you can run the server with:
```bash
cd server
yarn install
yarn dev
```

### Test accounts
You can sign up with any personal email address. However, if you want to use the test accounts, you can use the following credentials:
#### Admin
email: `test1@esn.world`   
password: `testuser1!`

#### Section member
email: `test2@esn.world`   
password: `testuser2!`

**Watch out**: sometimes it is surprisingly hard to log out of the app, make sure to clear the entire application storage in you dev tools and log out form [tumi.esn.world](https://tumi.esn.world/profile) if your users seems to get stuck.
